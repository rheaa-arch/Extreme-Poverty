# Project Overview

This project analyzes **global extreme poverty trends over a 10-year period (2014–2023)** using multiple poverty metrics to move beyond simple headcount measures. The focus is on understanding **not only how many people are extremely poor, but how deep and severe that poverty is across regions**.
    
The analysis emphasizes **poverty severity (Squared Poverty Gap Ratio / SPR)**, supported by headcount, poverty gap, inequality indicators, inflation context (CPI), and welfare type (income vs consumption).
    
This project was developed as part of a **guided learning process**, with a strong emphasis on analytical reasoning, metric selection, and interpretation rather than visualization alone.
